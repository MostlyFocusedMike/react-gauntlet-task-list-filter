# Task List App

For our first challenge, we're going to be making a "deluxe" to do list app!

Remember, the goal is to push yourself primarily with speed.

- Do not use any AI tools or Google searches for any part of this challenge
- Complete the tasks in 45 minutes or less.

TODO: add tests so they can be sure it's doing things correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

The rough bones of the application have been provided for you (we're using Tailwind for styling, you should not need to alter any styles for this challenge)
Several pieces have been hard coded, but in the final application they should be generated via code.

Here are all the features that you should be able to add.

A user:

- Can enter and save a task
- Can check tasks off to mark them complete
- Can Delete (as in fully remove) a task
- Click through to see the 3 states: all tasks, active tasks, and done tasks
- Edit the text of any tas
